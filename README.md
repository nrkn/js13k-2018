## Story

Our hero starts in a little house

The house has a bed, shower, food machine and computer terminal

The player can bump the computer to interact with it

It serves to explain the story to the player and control the food machine

The food machine works like a star trek replicator

The computer is broken and some of its functions are *offline* - the player will
need to find several components to get it fully working

The player needs food to survive - with the computer not working properly the
food machine is running in emergency backup mode and can only provide enough
food for the player to travel a short distance from their home before they need
to go home and get food again

Their first task is to explore the area around their home and find a component
to fix the computer, so they can get the food machine running properly and
get enough food to explore further afield, and find more of the components the
computer needs

- who is the player?
- why are they here?
- what do they want, once the immediate problems with computer are solved?
